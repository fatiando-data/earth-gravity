## Changes made

> These are the changes made to the original dataset.

* Convert the grid from the ASCII format of ICGEM to CF-compliant netCDF.
* Add relevant metadata, including names, units, datum, etc.
* Fix grid coordinates to be generated by `numpy.linspace` instead
  `numpy.arange` (or the equivalent used by ICGEM internally) to guarantee
  equal spacing to a higher accuracy.
* Export to compressed netCDF.

## About this repository

This is a place to format and prepare the original dataset for use in our
tutorials and documentation.

We include the source code that prepares the datasets for redistribution by
filtering, standardizing, converting coordinates, compressing, etc.
The goal is to make loading the data as easy as possible (e.g., a single call
to `pandas.read_csv` or `xarray.load_dataset`).
Whenever possible, the code also downloads the original data (otherwise the
original data are included in this repository).

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** The easiest way to download this dataset is using
> [Pooch](https://www.fatiando.org/pooch), particularly to download straight
> from the DOI of a release.
